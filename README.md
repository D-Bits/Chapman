# About Project

The goal of this project is to create a simple, and repurposeable 
extract, transform, and load (ETL) program with Python that can 
be used, and reused, across multiple projects with only relatively 
minor changes to the underlying codebase.

## Tools Used

* SQLAlchemy 1.3.1
* psycopg2 2.7.7
